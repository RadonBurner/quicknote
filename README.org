Quicknote.el

It can be annoying to have to switch beetween documentation and code

* Install
To install the package you must download quicknote.el and load
it with (load-file "/path/to/quicnote") I highly reccomend byte-compiling it

* Customization
This package is trading customiziblity for perfomence
customizations must be done with editing source
** Border colour
To change the border colour go to quicknote.el M-x replace-string RET #00bcff RET now
type the hex of the colour you want to replace

** Changing keys
This must be done with the same replace-string method, do not change only the
the global set keys

* usage
(setq agendapath "/path/to/agenad") agenda must be called agenda.org)
'f7' to open agenda
'f8' to open note file, if note file not defined yet current file
will be set as the note file
'M-ยง' to set a new notefile
'f-3' to toggle shell
